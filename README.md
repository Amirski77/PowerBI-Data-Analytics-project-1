Power BI project: sales analysis, gross profit, GPM, data modeling.

## Overview
This project is a Power BI sales analytics dashboard focused on understanding revenue, cost structure, and profitability.
The main goal was to analyze gross profit and gross profit margin (GPM) across products and identify which products drive profit versus revenue.


## Data
- Sales transactions data  
- Product-level cost data  
- Currency-based pricing (USD / CAD)

The data was modeled using a star schema with fact and dimension tables to ensure efficient analysis and correct aggregation.
